# Eleventy Starter

Use this starter template to create a new Eleventy project with the click of a button! For more information about this repo, you can read [this series](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/how_to_build_github_starter_templates_for_Eleventy_to_make_your_projects_easier) documenting its creation.

Out of the box, you should have:

- Eleventy configured with reasonable defaults to build your pages
- Sass support and some boilerplate SCSS
- JavaScript and TypeScript support, including legacy bundles for older browsers
- Minimal PWA requirements already met
- A service worker with precaching and a cache-falling-back-to-network strategy in place
- Linters for CSS, JS, and HTML
- Support for JS tests
- CI checks, PR templates, and dependabot configuration

```sh
# install dependencies

npm start

# build the site for production
npm run build

# run linters all at once
npm run lint

# or run linters individually
npm run lint:css
npm run lint:js

# run tests once
npm run test

# run tests in "watch" mode
npm run test -- --watch

# run tests and generate a coverage report
npm run test -- --coverage

# run end to end tests
npm run test:e2e

# update any outdated npm dependencies
npm run update-deps
```
